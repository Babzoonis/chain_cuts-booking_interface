As you travel across different countries, you have no money, only gold. A golden chain with n links, and in each country you visit, there are hotels where you can pay with the links of this chain. The cost of one day equals one link.

You approach the hotel owner, and he says that he is willing to accept payment with the chain, but he has conditions. Firstly, you must make daily payments, and secondly, you must divide the chain into the minimum number of cuts to avoid damaging it. For example, a chain with 7 links can be divided into links of 1, 2, and 4. 

My code allows you to calculate the minimum number of links, displays payment methods, and shows the cutting points. All of this happens in a Python-written interface.
